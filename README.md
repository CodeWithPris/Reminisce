## Overview

Reminisce is a work-in-progress CRUD app that lets users document and relive their hiking adventures by adding locations to a map, journaling their experiences, and tracking trail conditions. Built with the MEVN stack), it allows users to upload photos, add notes, and select icons to describe trail conditions during their hikes.

## Goals

- **Develop a Visually Appealing, Responsive, and Accessible Website w/ an App Down the Road**: Design a visually appealing and easy-to-use website from scratch that works well on all devices. A template will be used at first to organize ideas, but the aim is to build the entire site from the ground up to strengthen web design skills. I also plan on delving into app making via Android once the website is fully created.
  
- **Utilize the Leaflet API for Map Generation**: Use the [Leaflet API](https://leafletjs.com/) to build a map centered on Indianapolis, Indiana, to showcase trails and parks in the state. The initial focus will be on Indiana, with plans to gradually expand coverage to neighboring states and eventually the whole U.S.
  
- **Expand Features for Enhanced User Experience**: Include features like trail reviews, filters to find trails by difficulty, a search option, and the ability to save favorite trails. Introduce a "Show and Tell" feature where users can view a slideshow of their hike with photos, videos, trail conditions, and notes, creating a movie-like experience of their journey.
  
- **Implement a Backend for User Profiles and Dashboards**: Develop a simple backend system that allows users to have personal profiles or dashboards where they can manage their journal entries, customize settings, and more, making the app more interactive and engaging.
  
- **Add FAQ and Blog/Updates Pages**: Create an FAQ page to address common questions and provide a user guide, including instructional videos. The blog page will feature updates on new site features, trails, gear reviews, user stories, and more, allowing users to create and share their own blog posts.

## Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Languages**: Javascript, Vue.js, Node.js.
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: MongoDB, Express.js.
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Netlify, Visual Studio Code.

## Getting Started
Coming soon.

## Project Progress:
- Currently create frameworks for website using a template created by [HTML5 UP!](https://html5up.net/). I'd like the site to look similar to the template I'm using once I begin to code by scratch.

## Challenges
Coming soon.

## Learnings
Coming soon.
